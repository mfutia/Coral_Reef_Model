dx/dt = Kx(1−x)(−1 +j(1−C) − σP(1−x) +φ(2x−1))

*Defined Variables (description in table)*

x = fraction of individuals (humans) in the population willing to participate in coral conservation
C = live coral cover 
P = Parrotfish abundance (try different values)

*Undefined Variables (description not in table)*

K = human growth rate per year
j = coral growth rate per year
σ = Parrotfish growth rate per year
φ = unknown interaction term

```{r}
#parameters
K = 1.014
j = 1.68
σ = 0.5
φ = 0.2

#equation - change in willingness to participate in coral conservaiton
change_wtp <- Kx(1−x)(−1 +j(1−C) − σP(1−x) +φ(2x−1))


```

Equilibrium points occur when dx/dt = 0. 

dx/dt = 0 at 3 points:

1) when x = 0

In this case, none of population supports coral reef conservation.

2) when (1-x) = 0 aka x = 1

In this case, all of population supports coral reef conservation.

3) When (−1 +j(1−C) − σP(1−x) +φ(2x−1)) = 0

-1 + j - jC - σP + σPx + 2φx - φ = 0

j - jC - σP + σPx + 2φx = 1

Not sure what this means...
